Occasionally when debugging it can be useful to run as a system account for checking permissions etc.<br /><br />A useful utility for this (in windows) is the "runas" command. &nbsp;For instance (from the command window):<br /><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">runas /user:"YourDomain\sassrv" "C:\Program Files\SAS\EnterpriseGuide\4.3\SEGuide.exe"</span><br /><br />or<br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">runas /user:"</span><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">YourDomain</span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">\sassrv" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\120\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\Ssms.exe"</span><br /><br />You will be prompted for the password before the client tool opens on your machine.<br /><br /><i>This post was inspired by the fact that one should not log into the application server as sassrv, to avoid conflicting / hung sessions in the STP server, but I can't find the SAS note to back this up! &nbsp;However those hung sessions were confirmed real.. </i>&nbsp;<b>Don't log into sasapp as sassrv.</b>
